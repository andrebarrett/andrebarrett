    <p><b>Payment and Refund Policy</b></p>
    <p><b>Order Acceptance and Cancellation.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;You agree that your order is an
            offer to buy all products and services listed in your order. All orders must be accepted by us or we will
            not be obligated to sell the products or services to you. We may choose not to accept orders at our sole
            discretion, even after we send you a confirmation email with your order information and details of the items
            you have ordered.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><b>Prices and Payment Terms.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;All prices, discounts, and promotions
            posted on this Website are subject to change without notice. The price charged for a product or service will
            be the price in effect at the time the order is placed and may be set out in your order confirmation email.
            Subject to our right to increase the cost of subscription-based services (as noted in the Section entitled
            “Sale of Subscription Services” below), price increases will only apply to orders placed after such changes.
            Posted prices do not include taxes or charges for shipping and handling. All such taxes and charges (if
            applicable) will be added to your purchase total, and will be itemized in your shopping cart and in your
            order confirmation email. We strive to display accurate price information, however we may, on occasion, make
            inadvertent typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions related to pricing and availability. We reserve
            the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time and to cancel any orders arising
            from such occurrences. We may offer from time to time promotions on the Website that may affect pricing and
            that are governed by terms and conditions separate from these Terms of Sale. If there is a conflict between
            the terms for a promotion and these Terms of Sale, the promotion terms will govern. Terms of payment are
            within our sole discretion, and payment must be received by us in the manner specified on the Website before
            our acceptance of an order. If using a credit card, you represent and warrant that (i) the credit card
            information you supply to us is true, correct and complete, (ii) you are duly authorized to use such credit
            card for the purchase, (iii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit card company, and (iv)
            you will pay charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including shipping and handling charges and all
            applicable taxes, if applicable, regardless of the amount quoted on the Website at the time of your
            order.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><b>Sale of Goods.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;The Website may from time to time offer the sale of
            tangible products (“goods”) to you. We will arrange for shipment of goods to you. Please check the
            individual product page for specific delivery options. You will pay all shipping and handling charges
            specified during the ordering process. Shipping and handling charges are a reimbursement for the costs we
            incur in the processing, handling, packing, shipping, and delivery of your order. Title and risk of loss
            pass to you upon our transfer of the goods to the shipping carrier. Shipping and delivery dates are
            estimates only and cannot be guaranteed. We are not liable for any delays in shipments. Unless a return
            policy for goods is posted on the Website at the time of your purchase, the sale of all goods on the Website
            is final and non-returnable. However, to the extent a return policy is posted on the Website at the time of
            your purchase, we will accept a return of any goods pursuant to such return policy. To return goods, you
            must email us at&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:support@mikedillard.com"><span
                style="font-weight: 400;">support@mikedillard.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;before
            shipping your goods. No returns of any type will be accepted without first emailing us as specified above.
            You are responsible for all shipping and handling charges on returned goods. You bear the risk of loss
            during shipment. Your refund will be credited back to the same payment method used to make the original
            purchase on the Website. If you can show that a good shipped by us was in defective condition before being
            given over to the carrier for shipment to you, we will accept a return of the defective good and provide a
            replacement to you if available (or refund your purchase price if no replacement is available).&nbsp;</span>

    <p><b>Sale of Subscription/Membership Services</b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;The Website may from time to time offer optional subscription services (or
            subscription membership programs) for specified users (“Subscription Services”). By selecting a Subscription
            Service, you agree to pay us the subscription or usage fees indicated for that service on the Website.
            Payments for subscription services will be charged on the day your Subscription Service goes into effect and
            will cover the use of that service for the period indicated. Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments (or
            other periodic payments as specified on the Website at the time of purchase) will continue to be charged to
            your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your Subscription Service. The amount of the
            recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Subscription Service you
            selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable
            subscription fee increases. Subscription Services must be cancelled in writing (by email to&nbsp;</span><a

                style="font-weight: 400;">support@mikedillard.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) at least
            thirty (30) days prior to your next recurring payment in order to avoid billing of the next Subscription
            Service recurring payment. Subscription Service fees are not prorated or refundable, unless expressly stated
            otherwise on the Website. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we reserve the right to
            either suspend or terminate your Subscription Services. Any such suspension or termination will result in
            the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Subscription Services. You agree to submit
            any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing (at the email address above) to us within sixty
            (60) days after such charge, otherwise such dispute is waived by you and such charge will be final and not
            subject to challenge.&nbsp;</span></p>

            affiliated entity or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries.</span></p>
    <p><b>Dispute Resolution</b></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
            of the State of Texas and any dispute shall be subject to binding arbitration in Travis County, Texas.
            &nbsp;If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that
            provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability
            of any remaining provisions.</span></p>
    <p><b>Class Action Waiver</b></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a
            claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class
            arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations
            aren’t allowed.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not
            otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action,
            consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless all relevant parties specifically agree to do
            so following initiation of the arbitration.</span></p>
    <p><b>Severability</b></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If any clause within the Terms of Service (other than the Class Action Waiver
            clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from the Terms of
            Service, and the remainder of these Terms of Service will be given full force and effect. If the Class
            Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the dispute will be decided by a court.</span>
