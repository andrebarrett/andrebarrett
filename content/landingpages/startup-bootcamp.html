        No matter what your passion, hobby, or skill is… Software Bootcamp will give you a simple guide to get your software business up and running fast and turn your software development skills into a profitable side-hustle by doing something you actually enjoy.

      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
          Successful software developers are not the ones you work with. Let's face it. They argue about which software design pattern to use, they complain about how the codebase needs refactoring and that the current architecture isn't clean enough. They want SOLID principles through the code base but forget what really counts. Having a SOLID bank account that allows you to enjoy life. Successful developers make money online and then travel the world without worrying about paying the bills or where their next paycheck is going to come from.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Using the Startup Bootcamp, you’ll be able to create a super easy side-hustle that only takes a few hours a week to work on. Or if you so choose, you can spend a little more time on it and turn it into your own profit generating asset!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Whether you have just landed your first graduate role in software development, or someone who has a ton of experience coding, or if you’re someone who hasn't written a line of code yet but you are able to think logically…
        </p>

      <div>
        <p>
          Startup Bootcamp will give you insight into what’s working NOW to get an online business up and running fast and get handsomely rewarded by using your development skills!

          People Who Are Less Adept At Software Development, Actually Find It Easier To Make Money Online!        </h3>

      <p>
        The best way to find success making money online is not to focus on your coding. You have this skillset down already! Instead you need to focus on the thing that matters the most. Business!
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
It doesn't matter if you know nothing about business or making money. You didn't know the first thing about coding when you first started right? But look how far you've come        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          You probably know a person or you’ve heard of a person who may not be the best software developer but they have made a ton of money online. Heck just go to Youtube. You'll see dozens of young kids that have becomes super successful. Why is that? </p>

      <div>
        <p>
          No, it’s simply because they tried. They didn't let the fear of not knowing what to do or not having the correct skillset to make it work hold them back. They just wanted to achive something so they put effort into it  </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
You see our world is built on connection. It's a necessity to connect for survival, for friendship, for love, for growth and to make money. But as software developers we tend to feel more comfortable being introverted. We are afraid to put ourselves out there. We hold ourselves back. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
Here is what Mark Zuckerberg had to say about connection.      </div>
  

      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
        <strong>
        “When I was building Facebook I was just trying to help connect people… you couldn’t find and connect with the people that you cared about, which as people is actually the most important thing.”
      </strong>

      </div>
      <div class="col-10">
        <p>
          <br />
          Connecting with people is how we offer our products and services. They value and want our services. But we need to connect with them to deliver and in return get paid.

    <h3>Why it is so easy to make money online</h3>
    <p>Which leads me to an important truth …</p>

        <p>The better you are at connecting with people and attracting them to check out your services and digital products, the
          more successful you’ll be.</p>
        <p>And the good news is, compared to the complex problems you solve on a daily basis as a software engineer, this is easy!</p>
        <p>Just imagine for a second what it would mean for you if hundreds or even thousands or even tens of thousands
          of people from around the world see and buy your products and services. You’d have a much greater impact.</p>
        <p>Your income would skyrocket.</p>
        <p>And you’d have the beginnings of a VERY successful online business.</p>
        <p>In fact, once people start buying your product, they’ll likely want you to create even MORE products (and
          oftentimes they’ll email you and tell you what they want!).</p>

        <h3>My $150,000 Dollar Startup Lesson</h3>
          <p class="center-subtitle">Before I developed the Startup Bootcamp, I used to really struggle as an entrepreneur.</p>
              <p>I had never been taught business at school and was never really that interested in making money. I just wanted to work on cool software projects that were interesting.

                <p>I was, however, inspired by some of the famous software developers such as Bill Gates and Elon Musk that had created something the world wanted and used.</p>
                <p>So I set out to build something I thought the world needed. An events platform that would change how we discover and engage with up-coming events. Think of Eventbrite crossed with Instagram and you will be close to what I had in mind.</p> 
                
                <p>You can see some screenshots of the app below. For no other reason than I thought it was a cool name, I called the website and app Onit. To this day I still cringe even just saying the name ...</p>

    <p>I wasn't alone in this endeavor. I hired some inexperienced software developers and personally mentored and trained them. In doing so I discovered I had a real talent for teaching and making things easy to understand. They eventually became great software engineers.</p>

    <h3>My First Major Product Launch Was A Disaster!</h3>
    <p>The sofware worked well. Both website and app had a great user interface, nicely designed and was simple to use. Being one of the best software developers in the UK I expected nothing less. <b>The problem was, no one wanted to use it!</b></p>

    <p>I had made three of the biggest mistakes a Startup could make.
      <li>Firstly I had designed and developed something for myself assuming that lots of other people would want it too. </li> 
      <li>Secondly I had not tested the market to see if there was a demand.</li>
      <li>Third, I knew nothing about marketing.</li>

    </p>
    <p>I had spent so much time focusing on becoming the best software engineer I could that it never occured to me that I needed to learn anything about marketing.</p>
    <p>I had the "if you build it they will come" mentality. If I ever find the person that made me believe this nonsense I will beat him to a pulp!</p>
    <p>Up until now <b>I had spent over $150,000 dollars on developing this software!</b> Most of this money was spent on paying employees but I had also been renting office space, buying computer and office equipment, paying utility bills, paying accountancy fees and even local area office tax.</p>
    <p>With no one using the app or website there was literally no way to recoup this money!</p>

              <p>I believed if I could just market the app people would want to use it for sure. So I devised all sorts of clever marketing tactics to build brand awareness and get people to download it.

  While these techniques can make you famous without having to be a mainstream celebrity, it is NOT an employment opportunity or talent agency. 

It is NOT a way to amass a large amount of wealth without working hard.

And it is NOT a chance to join some kind of network that will do all the hard work for you.

Most people who watch this masterclass get the “how to” but never take action with the information. I’m only sharing what has worked for me and my students.

Your results are dependent on many factors… including but not limited to your ability to work hard, commit yourself, and do whatever it takes.

If you're not willing to accept that, please DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS BOOTCAMP.

But… If you’re ready…
