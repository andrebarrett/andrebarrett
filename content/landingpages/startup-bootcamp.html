        No matter what your passion, hobby, or skill is… Software Bootcamp will give you a simple guide to get your software business up and running fast and turn your software development skills into a profitable side-hustle by doing something you actually enjoy.

          Successful software developers are not the ones you work with. Let's face it. They argue about which software design pattern to use, they complain about how the codebase needs refactoring and that the current architecture isn't clean enough. They want SOLID principles through the code base but forget what really counts. Having a SOLID bank account that allows you to enjoy life. Successful developers make money online and then travel the world without worrying about paying the bills or where their next paycheck is going to come from.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Using the Startup Bootcamp, you’ll be able to create a super easy side-hustle that only takes a few hours a week to work on. Or if you so choose, you can spend a little more time on it and turn it into your own profit generating asset!
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether you have just landed your first graduate role in software development, or someone who has a ton of experience coding, or if you’re someone who hasn't written a line of code yet but you have a logic mind…

          Here’s A Weird But True Fact: 
          People Who Are Less Adept At Software Development, Actually Find It Easier To Make Money Online!        </h3>

        The best way to find success making money online is not to focus on your coding. You have this skillset down already! Instead you need to focus on the thing that matters the most. Business!
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
It doesn't matter if you know nothing about business or making money. You didn't know the first thing about coding when you first started right? But look how far you've come        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          You probably know a person or you’ve heard of a person who may not be the best software developer but they have made a ton of money online. Heck just go to Youtube. You'll see dozens of young kids that have becomes super successful. Why is that? </p>

      <div>
        <p>
          No, it’s simply because they tried. They didn't let the fear of not knowing what to do or not having the correct skillset to make it work hold them back. They just wanted to achive something so they put effort into it  </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
You see our world is built on connection. It's a necessity to connect for survival, for friendship, for love, for growth and to make money. But as software developers we tend to feel more comfortable being introverted. We are afraid to put ourselves out there. We hold ourselves back. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
Here is what Mark Zuckerberg had to say about connection.      </div>
  

      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
        <strong>
        “When I was building Facebook I was just trying to help connect people… you couldn’t find and connect with the people that you cared about, which as people is actually the most important thing.”

      <div class="col-10">
        <p>
          <br />
          Connecting with people is how we offer our products and services. They value and want our services. But we need to connect with them to deliver and in return get paid.

      <div class="one-half column value">
        <p>The better you are at connecting with people and attracting them to check out your services and digital products, the

        <p>And the good news is, compared to the complex problems you solve on a daily basis as a software engineer, this is easy!</p>
        <p>Just imagine for a second what it would mean for you if hundreds or even thousands or even tens of thousands
          of people from around the world see and buy your products and services. You’d have a much greater impact.</p>

          My $150,000 Dollar Startup Lesson</h3>
          <p class="center-subtitle">Before I developed the system I’m going to share with you, <br>I used to have a really
            hard time getting people to buy my products and services…</p>
              <p>In fact, for the first half of my business career I was jumping from one business to the other trying to
                make something work.</p>
              <p>The one thing that always stopped me was my ability to reach new customers and get them to buy my products
                or services.</p>
              <p>Often times I would spend several months creating a really amazing product or service that I <em>knew</em>
                certain people out there would love.</p>
              <p>The only problem was I could never get enough people to buy from me to see any REAL success.</p>
              <p>It wasn't until I learned a very important lesson about marketing, (which led me to create the system I'm
                about to share with you), that things started taking off and I started making some real money from my
                businesses…</p>
              <p>When I was 22 years old, I decided to get into real estate &mdash; because I thought that might be a good
                way to make money (I didn't know why, but I always saw real estate agents wearing nice clothes and driving
                expensive cars).</p>
              <p>So after I got my real estate license and set up my business, I had to start looking for customers.</p>
              <p>The only problem is I didn't know where to begin!</p>
              <p>I knew there were people out there who needed my services, but I didn't know where to start looking for
                them.</p>
              <p>So I decided to check out some marketing seminars, but that didn’t work out very well because…</p>

      <div class="row" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2em;">
        <div class="one-half column value">
          <p>There was a guy on stage who was teaching a group of real estate agents how to create flyers and
            advertisements to attract new clients.</p>
          <p>It seemed interesting, and at the end of the seminar I went to the back of the room and bought a copy of
            these “do-it-yourself” ad templates.</p>
          <p>I took one of the ads in the book, and ran it in my local real estate paper.</p>
          <p>I spent a few hundred bucks on the ad.</p>
          <p>The ad had a picture of a director's chair with no one sitting in it, and a headline that said, "Eben Pagan
            is too busy helping people buy and sell real estate to pose for pictures.”</p>

          <p><strong>...Nobody called.</strong></p>
          <p>I didn't get a single call from that ad.</p>
          <p>(well I did, but they were from a couple of my friends who called to say they saw my ad and thought it
            looked GREAT...lol)</p>
          <p>But not a single call from a potential client. Negative $300.</p>

      <p class="center-subtitle">Fast forward a few months, I went to a second marketing seminar…</p>
      <div class="row" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2em;">
        <div class="one-half column value">
          <p>Here, they were teaching a very different kind of marketing called “direct response marketing.”</p>
          <p>In direct response marketing, the goal of your marketing is not to get your name “out there,” but to
            <strong>get your customers to actively come find you.</strong></p>
          <p>A very different approach, and somewhat counter-intuitive...</p>
          <p>On stage, this guy was teaching people how to generate a flood of leads by giving away a free report to his
            customers if they called in.</p>
          <p>Lightbulb!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-half column value">
          <p>After the seminar, I decided I would try the same...</p>
          <p>So I spent another night creating an ad that had a completely different approach. The headline said:</p>
          <p>“Free Report Reveals Expensive Mistakes To Avoid If You’re Buying Or Selling A Home…”</p>
          <p>Then I went to the same real estate paper, and spent the same money to run this new ad.</p>

            business.</p>
          <p>This is my complete “go to” traffic system that I’ve personally used in 10 different markets, and the
            students I’ve taught it to have used in dozens others…</p>
          <p>If you've got a product or service, but you aren’t getting the amount of people you want to show up and
            buy, then this program is going to teach you how to get the sales you need…</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-half column value">
          <p>If you’re just getting started in business and nobody seems to be visiting your site, this program will fix
            your “traffic” program – and you’ll start getting more traffic than you can handle….</p>
          <p>If you want to grow your email list, this program is going to show you how to set up the marketing system
            to capture leads and grow your list.</p>

  While these techniques can make you famous without having to be a mainstream celebrity, it is NOT an employment opportunity or talent agency. 

It is NOT a way to amass a large amount of wealth without working hard.

And it is NOT a chance to join some kind of network that will do all the hard work for you.

Most people who watch this masterclass get the “how to” but never take action with the information. I’m only sharing what has worked for me and my students.

Your results are dependent on many factors… including but not limited to your ability to work hard, commit yourself, and do whatever it takes.

If you're not willing to accept that, please DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS BOOTCAMP.

But… If you’re ready…
