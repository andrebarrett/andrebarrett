## I'm Andre Barrett. I live in London where I run multiple business ventures and write software.

I have loved writing software ever since I wrote my first few lines of executable code when I was 10 years old. One of my fondest memories is of the first ever computer I ever owned; the Sinclair ZX Spectrum (which coincidentally is as old as I am).

My dream growing up was to be an inventor. And I soon found out, the only thing I loved as much as computers was being an entrepreneur. It turned out to be the perfect pairing. I could create things for people and sell it to them. Looking back, it seems staring my digital agency iMobilize was inevitable.

Today, I’m the founder of Barrett Ventures. It's a holding company that starts, buys and ultimately incubates small companies so they can scale. We put in place the operational expertise, technology and marketing necessary to provide these businesses with substantial growth. The portfolio of Barrett Ventures currently includes businesses in industries such as engineering, fitness, property development, online education and fintech.

Amongst helping to run these various companies, I also consult and offer coaching services for business and investing.
