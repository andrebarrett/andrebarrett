## Trading Background
I have actively traded the financial markets since 2010. My trading experience includes trading Shares, CFD, Spread Betting and Options. I trade in asset classes such as Currencies, Commodities, Equities and Indices.

I have undertaken various Financial Education courses always seeking to improve my understanding of the financial markets. The list of which can be seen below.

My trading style is a Top Down Macroeconomic Asset selection process for generating trade ideas in:
Indices
Equities
Commodities
Currencies
Rates

I use a Top Down and Bottom Up appraisal for Sector and Stock selection. The process involves calculating Statistical Distribution of:
Asset Returns
OHLC Volatility
An Implied Volatility Assessment across Equities, Currencies, and Commodities.

I use GDP Correlations (Lag Effects) to Asset Prices, Industry Sector (Value Chain) analysis, Stock analysis using Fundamental, Technical and Price action in order to generate trade ideas for Alpha.

All of this is then overlaid with Risk Management using:
Watchlist generation
Technical chart analysis and price action
Beta Hedging (Equities)
Portfolio Construction Parameters
Long/Short Equity selection
Kelly criterion (all asset classes).
